# The Soft Stuff is the Real Stuff: Reframing librarianship through a relational-cultural lens&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Veronica Arellano Douglas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Anastasia Chiu&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Joanna Gadsby&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Alana Kumbier&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Lalitha Nataraj<br><br>Veronica talks about how their community of practice has come about; Veronica wrote a blog post about a year ago about relational (?) and her feelings&#8230; that&#x27;s what she does. Research on feminized labor dovetails with relational focus&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>They&#x27;re a reading group, share perspectives&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Alana&#x27;s intro to relational cultural theory:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stone Center at Wellesley College, feminist model of human development; clients mostly white heterosexual women in relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later folks (women of color, queer folks, etc) recognized the limits of looking primarily&#x2F;exclusively at sexism, now about other systems of oppression as well&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>First tenent of relational-cultural theory is connection;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>Judith Jordan: &quot;Connection is at the core of human growth &amp; development&#8230; We all grow in, through, and towards relationship.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Alana says that she often uses this with students to focus on the connections we build, that we competence in connection, not alone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Anastaia: Second tenet is mutuality&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>appreciation for the wholeness of the other person &amp; their subjective experience&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>intersubjective mutuality; goes beyond simple recognition and toward (affirmation? I missed that word)&#8230; two-wayness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>how she puts this into cataloging work is to consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul class="indent"><li>will users see themselves acruaately and thoughtfully in the catalog?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>how to balance cataloging work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><li>relational instinct is very much about efficiency, authority&#8230; how to balance humanity in cataloging &amp; interoperability of the file&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Veronica: mutuality really helps facility what bell hooks calls &quot;engaged pedagogy&quot; where students as well as teachers grow through the process&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>respect for knowledge &amp; experience that people bring into classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>mutality also has helped Veronica think about her relationship to work, helps reframe her workplace as not a concept but a colletion of people&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Joanna: empathy&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>in relational context, &quot;empathy&quot; goes beyond common place sense of this&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>requires a well-differentiated sense of self &amp; appreciation for the other person&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>very much a mutual flow of empathy &amp; appreciation for each others&#x27; humanity&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>mutual, multi-directional, not just &quot;I feel your pain&quot; which is unidirectional and can be shallow&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>if we demonstrate that we can respond to another&#x27;s pain, we go beyond recognition, it goes beyond neutrality&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>it&#x27;s bold to approach the reference desl; we should recognize that&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>one-shots can be invasive to classroom community that we visit&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>anticipatory empathy, orient the students when they come to class; have some sort of grounding in &quot;here&#x27;s where we are, here&#x27;s the nearest water &amp; restrooms, we all need to be humans, including me&quot; so orients people in space as well foster a feeling of connection and atmosphere of care&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li></ul>Joanna: vulnerability&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>a person&#x27;s ongoing ability to represent themselves in a relationship more fully&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>decentering herself as the authority &amp; letting students lead the way more&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Lalitha: vulnerability also pertains professionally, particularly for marginalized people who might not feel comfortable representing their authentic self at their institution&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>can create safe spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>draw from personal &amp; professional experiences to build connection with students, particularly when disclose own experiences &amp; margialization, i.e. within Chicana &#x2F; Latinx communities at school&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>openness, Judith Jordan says we must be open to moving, to being moved (I missed most of that quote)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>can be open if not trapped in a &quot;power over&quot; dynamic, where one person sets the rules of the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Anastasia: openness in dynamics of our work&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>what sort of harm is done to the people our systems are in relation with?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>how can we make Library of Congress subject headings more open to community input, LCSH currently changes &#x2F; grows through a weighty &amp; lengthy process&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>bias in the publication process tilts LCSH process of finding &quot;literary warrant&quot; against the interests of marginalized communities being better represented through LCSH terms&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Violet Fox&#x27;s cataloging lab is a good move toward power-with dynamics for cataloging&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Veronica: power with dynamic&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>our profession is feminized but not feminist&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>practice of relational cultural theory actively subverts power structures by actively dispersing power (two other things as well that I missed)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>desire to lift everyone up together&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>as a new manager she sees how it can be isolating, but also tension about laying her managerial duties at the feet of those she manages, since she&#x27;s a manager not only in name but also in salary difference&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>team meetings don&#x27;t just talk about things they need to accomplish but also their feelings &amp; concerns, talk about their emotioal labor as teaching librarians&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>that sounds great &amp; rosy, but there&#x27;s also conflicts&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Alana: valuing conflict&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>&quot;conflict positive&quot; was something Alana heard from a student recently&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>there&#x27;s a lot of really valid reasons for conflict to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>conflict as not a threat but as an opporunity for accountability&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>hear how people experience a situation &amp; hear their perspective&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>listen to everyone, then respond together&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>takes a growth mindset and trying to move into that together&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>try to get beyond who did what &amp; its effects, but to listen for the underlying systems &amp; practices and see what of those can be alterered&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Veronica: leads us into a small group discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Audience discussion&#x2F;questions&#x2F;comments (good use of microphone so far!)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Emily Drabinski: a lot of this work is predicated on being at an institution that&#x27;s workable; Joanna says that presenting these ideas as big ideas is in order to see if there are small places to put these things into our work&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Person 2: &quot;Struggle with sense of wanting to the this work, but also there&#x27;s an American cultural tendency to be very transactional.&quot; In a professional setting, how might the transactional be more professional &#x2F; effective?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Person 3: Conflict. She &amp; another of her colleagues acknowledge &amp; model respectful disagreement in from of the students they supervise&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Karen, Northeast U in Boston: appreciates concreteness, things like orienting students in building; One of the first things one of her colleagues always asks in a consultation is &quot;can I get you a cup of water?&quot; Anther person talks about of being intentional. Third in group talked about own supervisor about being transparent about information, not hiding until everything&#x27;s settled. Lunchtime reading group, in critical librarianship. Allows them to be more informal, outside usual dynamics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li></ul>Person 5: She&#x27;s conflict averse &amp; works with people who are conflict averse. How to you point out a problem without being labeled the problem? (I think that was her question)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>Alana: aversion to conflict is part of how institutions resist equity, diversity, inclusion work; how can we have diversity &#x2F; difference without recognizing that this takes work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Anastasia: therapist suggests the tactic of saying that you want to bring the point of conflict back up again later, preparing each other for the discussion so it doesn&#x27;t just toxically linger but also so that there&#x27;s consent about revisiting the conflict again in the safest possible situtation&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Lali: one thing great about her current department is that it&#x27;s built on a lot of trust; psychological safety, they feel that around each other so they can focus on a goal and put aside other interpersonal things that could create tension to push toward the goal&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Veronica: important for people in quasi-positions of power to protect those with less power; as the instruction coordinator she takes on the role of saying no to inappropriate teaching requests, sees that conflict as an moment of affirmation&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Person 6: tension between these ideas, which have a lot of salience with students and management, but tension with dynamic of librarians not having expertise recognized by faculty. Can you address that tension?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>Veronica: relational growth encourages you to keep relationships that help you grow &amp; are healthy and to discard negative ones if you&#x27;re in a situation that lets you&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>Anastasia&#x27;s reflection questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - How can you keep this going?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (one I missed)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - What have you heard today that makes you want to move forward with an intentional practice of rct?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>---&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Welcome to pad.riseup.net!<br><br>WARNING: This &quot;pad&quot; is a collaborative document that can be edited by anyone who has the URL.
