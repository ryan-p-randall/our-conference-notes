would be used more with health studies while &quot;marijuana&quot; would be used more in criminal justice disciplines&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Questions about &quot;query expansion&quot; with their databases&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Political context around marijuana has changed dramatically since about 1996, when California legalized (medical?) use, then Colorado later did recreational legalization, now 33 states + DC have some form&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Almost all of the states where it&#x27;s illegal (except one) voted for Trump in the last presidental election (I think Kevin said the exception is Virginia?)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Academic Search Premier, which allows you to turn off the &quot;apply related words&quot; feature (the query expansion), also lets you save citations to CSV format (which lets them download &amp; use the results at scale)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>10,479 articles, 5,643 articles on &quot;cannabis&quot;, 4,836 articles on &quot;marijuana,&quot; after they vetted the results according to a few parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Hand coded representative sample of 540 articles, which is about 5.2% total dataset; ended up being 90 work hours&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Coded whole set separately, then combined&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>categories:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

legal constraints?)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Discussion &amp; Implications&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Words Matter; words that we think mean the same thing don&#x27;t necessarily mean the same thing&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; They&#x27;d like vendors to inform users that a related term has been applied&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell users what related terms are&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allow users to turn off query expansion&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Proquest doesn&#x27;t let you turn query expansion of&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Google does in advanced, if you use &quot;verbatim&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Shoutout to Dr. Safiya Noble&#x27;s Algorithms of Oppression&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>a vendor they contacted to see if &quot;marijuana&quot; and &quot;cannabis&quot; are synonyms said yes, but wouldn&#x27;t let them see the synonym thesaurus because that&#x27;s proprietary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We need to talk with students about how algorithms work, and this is an easily comprehensible way to&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>emphasize that Language is politicized, as the keynote today said&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>refugees &amp; immigrants&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>ask audience to think about identities that collide with politics, think about other examples &#x2F; scenarios around that&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>q: in oregon a term often used is &quot;CBD&quot;. where did that fall in here?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>a: they&#x27;d have to search again and code it again&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>q: did many articles use the terms interchangably&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; a: for granularity reasons, they mostly coded just the abstract, so they can&#x27;t speak to that in too much detail&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>q: any plans to expand this to more subject-specific databases? I&#x27;m a medical librarian and this is really relevant, also curious about how this works in primary databases&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; a: were limited by Ebsco being only database that lets you turn off query expansion&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>q: curious about selection process, was it random?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>a: alphabetized by title by year, then chose every 20th one from that year&nbsp;&nbsp;</ul><br>q: excluding articles not written in english, is it possible that the discrepancy in international article is due to British English, because of colonialism?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="indent"><li>a: that could be a reason.
