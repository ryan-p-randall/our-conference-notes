This etherpad is for the ALAAC2018 Saturday 4:00pm--5:00pm session:  
[New Librarians on the Block: Early Career Librarianship, Management, and Leadership](https://www.eventscribe.com//2018/ALA-Annual/fsPopup.asp?Mode=presInfo&PresentationID=352459)

Please add your name using the "multiple people" icon on the right so we know who to thank for helping take group notes!  

## Panel  

- Surveyed folks for early, mid, and late career responses  
- more than half of early-career librarians have experience supervising people. 84% of mid to late career did (recognize might be a limitation of response pool & how respondents were found)  

- one word that did not overlap when they asked for valued management skills: early career valued "team" (12%) but that didn't show up for mid to late career librarians  
- The Collective conference: Design Thinking workshops metaphors  
- Mentoring: as manager, one of the best things you can do is help others make connections, recognize your limitations/inexperience and try to connect people with those they can learn most from  
- Mentors can be peers, even people with utterly different job but with perspective from which you can learn, even people outside of libraries but with insights into institutions or job scenarios  
- Structure of mentoring & who is mentored has problems  

- Examples of best practices in action:  
  - exchange of feedback with mentor / supervisor in informal setting  
  - proposals for professional devlopment opportunities (share it with a bunch of people, both friend & formal networks; seeing different points of view helped make a chapter proposal very strong)  
  - paraprofessional experiences  

- Changes in the profession:  
  - different structures for mentoring  
  - removing barriers to access  
  - implementing new values into practice  
  - self-advocate & advocate for others "in the middle" (levels of progression in their careers)  
  - fix your communication  

- New Member Round Table, list-servs, other tools through ALA for finding mentorship  

- Don't always take each person's advice at face value; very useful to find multiple mentorship perspectives  

- Q&A, not just for panelists but also among attendees {that's good practice! -Ryan}  

- powerpoint will be online afterwards so we can see their charts and bibliography
