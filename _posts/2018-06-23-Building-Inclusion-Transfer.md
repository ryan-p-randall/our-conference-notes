## Panel  

- Starts off with some definitions, of the institutions involved, of articulation agreements, of information literacy  
- Transfer student success is important in at least 32 states with statewide Articulation Agreements btw colleges & universities  
- Transfer students make up more than half of University of Central Florida's student body, have "Direct Connect" arrangement with designated partner colleges  

### Their research question: How does information literacy instruction elements of partner college librarians align with UCF information literacy instruction outcomes?  

- Partner colleges mostly did information literacy in face-to-face modality, but UCF mostly did it online  
- Partner colleges did embed information literacy instruction in about 50% of classes   

- For analysis, broke modules into groups, "Basic Elements" and "Advanced Elements"; found good alignment on many elements of information literacy between colleges and university  
- others with bigger gaps, especially around advanced things… many of which were around "scholarship is a conversation"  

- Literature review seemed to be least common between colleges & the university  

- "Transfer shock" - many possible causes, but librarians can help offset that negative impact is in information literacy instruction  

### Implications  

1. informs stakeholders of specific gaps between what is convered in information literacy instruction at the partner colleges and what "native" UCF students are being presented  
2. informs stakeholders of areas of gaps in framework coverage impacting transfer student preparedness  
3. confirms that the UCF modules align to the ACRL Framework, although being designed before them; Therefore the Standards are not diminished but rather integrated into the Framework  
4. asserts that Framework is a good foundation for student success {not sure this is what she said}   

- Framework as perhaps a concept-based, metacognitive approach rather than a clearly delineated, progress
- Partner College perspective: Emphasis on collaboration between partner colleges and UCF  

- Administrator's view: looking to avoid duplication of effort, how could this collaboration influence others?  
  - helps demonstrate the value added by library experience at two year colleges  
  - believes has implications beyond library world, could be a pilot that could influence other areas of operation, like writing centers that could align between institutions  
  - difference in experience in learning outcomes / assignments between courses given same numbering scheme, ideally could make these more connected between institutions  

- next steps:  
  - facility group discussion  
  - continued research

- Currently just have correlation between certain modules and grade impact, but nothing more granual than that  
- At Seminole State College, information literacy is a required outcome for graduation… so they have the ability to frame their work toward information literacy as working toward that campus-wide outcome whenever they're doing it
