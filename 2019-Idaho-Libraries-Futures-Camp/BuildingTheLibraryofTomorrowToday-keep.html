Marcellus Turner, Seattle Public Library&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Idaho Libraries Futures Camp&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Goals for today:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Not Bore You&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Not Mispronounce Words&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Not Leave a Thought Unfinished&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Learn something to take back to Seattle&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>If you were to build a library today, with no conception of libraries already in place:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- What would you build?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Who would we serve?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- How would we deliver these servers?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Who would work for you?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- What would be your mission?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He outlines what today&#x27;s presentation &#x2F; conversation will be about and will not be about&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This space is NOT:&nbsp;<br>- About leadership (directly anyway)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Size; it&#x27;s all relative and transferable&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This space is:&nbsp;<br>- Space of appreciation, honor, expectation, and opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- safe space&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- learning &#x2F; engagement space&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- space of good intentions&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- space of opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- and a space of celebration&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He&#x27;s:&nbsp;<br>1. the Official Bear Poker, he really relishing in &quot;poking the bear&quot;, the one who&#x27;ll ask questions like &quot;what are we going to do next?&quot; &quot;what will that look at?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>2. a librarian through and through, may different positions at different places&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>3. been in public, academic, etc (just not schools, but visits students)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>4. he&#x27;s a life-long librarian&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>5. he&#x27;s from Mississippin&#8230; he says &quot;who back then could imagine that a young black boy from Mississippi could grow up to be the head librarian of the Seattle Public Library?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>they&#x27;ve had 3 PR nightmares during his 8 years there:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Drag Queen story time (unexpected pushback)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- branding went very bad&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- restroom issues with trans population&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Strategic direction broken down into three circles:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- program of service; what promise individual patron &#x2F; user&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- areas of impact; what promised the city &#x2F; government the library would do&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- business model; what Seattle Public Library will do internally to prepare for what need to do in 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&quot;You can live through anything as long as you know how long it&#x27;ll be&quot; - a refrain he&#x27;s returning to throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>They do their review every three years; the structure of three bubbles doesn&#x27;t change every three years, but what&#x27;s in the three bubbles can change every three years&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>That one-page, three circle diagram IS their plan; there&#x27;s no 80 page version, not other version. So it&#x27;s easy for everyone to know what SPL will do, internally and externally&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Libraries &amp; librarianship affect:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- the profession&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- the association&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- the industry&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Our history:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- our sole job in libraries is to help someone else; we&#x27;re the only profession &#x2F; institutions that do that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- The Rule of 1965 (or 1969): librarians answer questions, check out things, and (??)&nbsp;<br>- Three Bs: books, bodies, or buildings&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- We can do whatever we want to do, we just can&#x27;t do everything&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Knowing the Challenges in order to meet the future:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- funding&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- technology&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- convenience&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- social issues, one of the biggest challenges to libraries anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- emotional&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- image: librarians, profession, association, industry&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- cars and others controlling our destiny: example of automobile industry getting rid of cd players when that&#x27;s what he wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- hard time with change&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- staffing the building &#x2F; straddling the river; need to figure out how to get librarians outside of our doors&#8230; perhaps we don&#x27;t need a librarian on the reference desk all the time&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- &quot;I have an iPhone, therefore I am&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- close enough: our public often doesn&#x27;t want the exact answer, but instead just want to know close enough&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Admits that first reference question when moved from academic libraries to public was &quot;do you have the Harry Potter books?&quot; and since he had no idea who Harry Potter was, he did an author search&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Solutions for a viable future:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- image, libration, and divestment&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- engagement vs outreach (community listening); when staff goes out, shut up. let community tell you what they want &#x2F; need, not what you&#x27;re doing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- becoming a socially-conscious library; you have got to do this. SPL doesn&#x27;t call homeless people &quot;homeless,&quot; calls them &quot;daily readers&quot; so that the staff reinforces people&#x27;s dignity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- creativity vs innovation; new solutions is creativity, he wants that as much as possible. librarians are not making a new way to read, but can make new ways to get innovations to patrons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- values; staff want to see same values in organization that they individually have&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- partnerships and relationships; needs to be two-ways&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- nimbleness and flexibility;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- whatever you&#x27;re teaching, I&#x27;m not hiring; if library schools aren&#x27;t thinking about social issues, he&#x27;s not hiring&#8230; (I think he means librarians needs values &amp; orientations, not skills)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- using data and metrics for decision-making&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- great customer service &#x2F; public safety &#x2F; incidents; we&#x27;ve got to get better, since community will compare us against all sorts of things&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- date to be different; don&#x27;t think every location needs to look the same when they serve slightly different needs &amp; populations&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- librarianship becoming professionally appealing; image of our work isn&#x27;t what it needs to be, like informatics vs libraries&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- experiences vs transactions; customer service, safety&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- intersection of influencers; SPL is going to start looking at what library work will be in 10 years; how will people searh for things?, what will finance look like?, we need to know these things in order to plan for future library needs &amp; services&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- funding: private dollars, grants, gifts; when a voter has to decide between libraries, police, and fire stations, we&#x27;re going to lose&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- staffing (we&#x27;re the most painfully polite profession, need to figure out how to get other professions into the building {teachers who can write lesson plans; reporters who can dig up information; social worker on staff}, diversity)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- equity vs equality; we need to focus on equity, not everyone can be supported in the same way, since there are different needs&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- expanding our industry network; spoke not to other librarians, but to other people in other industries who also deal with our issues, like transportation of people&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- external vs internal focus (outcomes and impacts);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- digging the ditch you&#x27;re gonna die in; if you feel strongly about the issue you want to tackle&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- mission; none of this is asking library workers to change mission&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>That dreaded box (and thinking outside it):&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- long haul, not a sprint&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- change takes time&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- directions &#x2F; fads &#x2F; trends&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- creative solutions&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>{photo of his old horoscope}&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>looks back at his goals&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- our passion and energy is something he&#x27;ll take back to Seattle&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>again, if you were to build the library of the future, would it look like what your library looks like now?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br>---&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Welcome to pad.riseup.net!<br><br>WARNING: This &quot;pad&quot; is a collaborative document that can be edited by anyone who has the URL.
