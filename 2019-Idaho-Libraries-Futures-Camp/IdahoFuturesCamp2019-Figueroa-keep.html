Big changes and compelling visions require some leaps of faith.&quot;<br><br>FIgueora contextualizes the above quote as explaining how Atlanta&#x27;s downtown was underdeveloped when people of means &amp; access moved away from downtown, with heavily racial aspects (that&#x27;s a clunky paraphrase on my part&#8212;Ryan)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>How to make this happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Make room for discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Make it a practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Connections make way for patterns to see where things are going.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Recognize that no one is an expert in everything. Pick the things you seek to be expert in and use your network to broaden expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Ask people what they are interested in. He says that often people will come up after a talk and explain that they already knew what Figueroa is discussing, but no one every asked them based on their job title, usually low in the organizational hierarchy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Newsletters he recommends:&nbsp;<br>- Y Pulse - about millential trends?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Education Dive&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- there are many others&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Practices to adopt:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Make time to regularly share and talk about new ideas and trends with others&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Intergrate new ideas and trends into existing spaces, services, and partnerships&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Track and follow new and developing ideas and trends as they relate to your library; follow other types of libraries, since their challenges &amp; opportunities will likely be ones your library will face, in some form&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Culture eats strategy for breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&quot;My vision is changing our how, more than seeing clearly our what. I see a how where we are all much more comfortable with change, and with our personal power to change conditions&#8230;. {another sentence I missed}&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- adrienne maree brown&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;ala&#x2e;org&#x2F;libraryofthefuture">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ala.org&#x2F;libraryofthefuture</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyletter&#x2e;com&#x2F;libraryofthefuture">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyletter.com&#x2F;libraryofthefuture</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q &amp; A&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q1: How do you gauge when something is a fad rather than a trend?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A: I think the main thing is persistence. Also we often think that popular culture trends are &quot;fads,&quot; while what&#x27;s in literature or scholarly is more &quot;trends.&quot; We should challenge that sort of strong division between popular culture &amp; serious culture. Fidget spinners weren&#x27;t just a fad, but a fad manifestation of a trend toward more participatory programming, can find underlying current that helps explain how it manifests in a particular fad. That&#x27;s better than just seeking a stark contrast between fad &amp; trend.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Person2: Thanks Miguel for saying he&#x27;d have librarians&#x27; backs by keeping tracks of things, person really appreciates his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A: It&#x27;s a challenge to keep up with that research &amp; synthesize it. We can help provide evidence that can sway some community or board members who respect expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q3: Is there one trend you think libraries should be aware of right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A: I would be deeply concerned about competition &amp; the privatization of public space. If we watch retailers, they&#x27;re moving toward &quot;experiential retail,&quot; since they can&#x27;t just be warehouses for things to be sold when competing with online sellers. For instance, Apple stores are highly experiential, design themselves as &quot;Town Squares.&quot; We in library work should be deeply concerned with this, because whether intentionally or not, they&#x27;re encroaching in the sorts of &quot;Third Spaces&quot; that are fulfilled by GLAM institutions (libraries, archies, mueseums, galleries). Apple encroaching on spaces, privatizing them, making them of interest to the people who can afford them. So we need to think about how we demonstrate the value of public space, especially public third spaces. Big difference between how private companies will treat third spaces and what they&#x27;ll be designed for and what library values will lead us to design third spaces for withour our communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>Welcome to pad.riseup.net!<br><br>WARNING: This &quot;pad&quot; is a collaborative document that can be edited by anyone who has the URL.
