# Maker Instruction through the Lens of Information&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Amy Vecchione &amp; Stephanie Milne-Lane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>## Amy Vecchione&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>- MakerLab has had a charge, starting from when it opened in early August 2015, to work with Faculty to meet information needs on Boise State University&#x27;s campus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- BSU&#x27;s MakerLab has done more with instruction than any other library we&#x27;re aware of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Most people in makerspaces at the time were in engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- at BSU, they partnered with people from Materials, from Chemistry, did podcasting instruction; often stations with equipment put out and allowing people to explore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- that was pedagogically sound, but they didn&#x27;t know quite what they were aiming at initially&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- arduino instruction for other library professionals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- how to teach 26 students how to sew when only have 3 sewing machines?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- often what&#x27;s being taught isn&#x27;t the explicitly stated content, but rather modeling a process of problem solving (MIT origins of making &#x2F; makerspaces article)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- alternate sewers, coaches, observers; then a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Discussion question for the audience: What have you made? (Active Learning Session)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - fancy dresses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - salads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - sundial that&#x27;s worn as a wrist watch for a student&#x27;s theatre costume&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- focus on receiving new information through making process&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Maker Competencies &amp; IMLS Grant Partnership (Spring 2018)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - Philosophy 306: Stephen Crowley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - History 346: Leslie Madsen; &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; multimedia assignment on telling Idaho history starting with shoes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - Maker Competencies (website that showcases BSU professor&#x27;s assignments?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;library&#x2e;uta&#x2e;edu&#x2F;makerliteracies&#x2F;competencies">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.uta.edu&#x2F;makerliteracies&#x2F;competencies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- feedback on competencies was often about how they weren&#x27;t unique to MakerSpaces, but rather &quot;just good teaching&quot; (according to an Education professor)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Amy says that she thinks the Maker Competencies kind of miss the mark in terms of being unique to MakerSpaces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&gt; &quot;The Mission of Librarians is to Improve Societty Through Facilitating Knowledge Creation in their Communities&quot; - R. David Lankes, Atlas of New Librarianship&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Discussion question for the audience: With that thing you said you made earlier, how did you construct knowledge?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>## Stephanie Milne-Lane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>- 2018 fieldwork focused on emerging technologies; went to ACRL Roadshow on Framework for Information Literacy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>- found that one MakerLab project fits all the ACRL Framework frames; &quot;Tactile Aids for Teaching Statistics to the Visually Imaired&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - &quot;Authority is constructed and cntextual&quot;: blind student was authority here? (I missed this)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - &quot;Information creation as process&quot;: lot of iterative version, using feedback from visually impaired users&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - &quot;Information has value&quot;: articulating copyright, etc&#8230; chose to go with open access licensing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - &quot;Research as inquiry&quot;- extends beyond academic world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - &quot;Scholarship as conversation&quot;: creative commons, so can be refined further by future users&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - &quot;Searching as strategic exploration&quot;: insteading of just searching right database or publication, instead searched for right materials as well as learn that their goal didn&#x27;t already exist in Thingiverse or elsewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- BSU MakerLab Toolkit made in part by conducting structured &amp; unstructured interviews of librarians&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;makerlab&#x2e;boisestate&#x2e;edu&#x2F;maker&#x2d;instruction&#x2d;toolkit&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makerlab.boisestate.edu&#x2F;maker-instruction-toolkit&#x2F;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- this was in part how they realized that there was a gap in library literature about how to use makerspaces for instruction, rather than just to small &quot;how-to&quot; instruction on how to make things&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>## Conclusions &amp; Questions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>- Amy says she&#x27;s honored to have been able to work with Stephanie, there were lots of &quot;aha!&quot; moments working with her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Amy draws our attention to <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;makerlab&#x2e;boisestate&#x2e;edu&#x2F;maker&#x2d;instruction&#x2d;toolkit&#x2F;matching&#x2d;the&#x2d;makerlab&#x2d;with&#x2d;acrl&#x2d;framework&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makerlab.boisestate.edu&#x2F;maker-instruction-toolkit&#x2F;matching-the-makerlab-with-acrl-framework&#x2F;</a> in particular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- libraries truly are the home for makerspaces, because interdisciplinary lens on information suits libraries the most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>### Q: what&#x27;s the future of making in libraries?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Amy: I&#x27;d like more people to see links to the Framework and see how information is involved.&nbsp;<br><br>Stephanie: I very intentionally made it clear between the making and the Framework frames. (They have a draft of an article on this, apparently.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>### Q: If you could waive a magic wand and have all faculties use makerspace, what would that be?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Amy: I&#x27;m not sure, but what I&#x27;ve seen this summer is close. Faculty with students working in their labs, seeing students as undergraduate researchers; having lower volume of printing Pokemon (which she stresses does have value) allows the space to be used more as for research &amp; information creation. Amy&#x27;s still doing a number of consultations, just a change in the type of usage. Would need to grow the space profoundly to meet this kind of interaction depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Stephanie: Need to document lesson plans; make toolkit super diverse &amp; always add to it so people can continually be inspired and see how experiential learning connects to whatever is done in higher education. Stephanie often hears that makerspaces are a fad that are going to go away, but she increasingly sees it as related to information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>### Q: Would it be better to split the &quot;Print Pokemon&quot; space from the research space?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Amy: I think it&#x27;s better to have them together, to show that it&#x27;s a continuum. For example, the person who did a marble run is now working on an IRB for working with at-risk youth in k-12 environment focusing on experiential learning for at-risk youth. One lead to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Another audience partipant says that having &amp; displaying Pokemon on student&#x27;s desk allowed them to be informal ambassadors for MakerLab &amp; making, plus taking ownership of making.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Amy rephrases that as &quot;learning information, sharing information, etc.&quot;; she can&#x27;t unsee how much information is tied to learning to make, sharing knowledge &#x2F; potential of making, adopting identity of being a Maker, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Amy shows us <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;makeher&#x2e;diy&#x2e;plymouthcreate&#x2e;net">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makeher.diy.plymouthcreate.net</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Amy&#x27;s working on makerspace (&quot;themes&quot;) to share out; demonstrating what library makerspaces do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Amy&#x27;s ultimate goal isn&#x27;t to rewrite or refine makerspace competencies but rather than refocus on how makerspaces lead to ACRL Framework for Information Literacy frames&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk about how Maker competencies process asked them to add equity, diversity, inclusion initiatives sort of at the end, rather than incorporate deeply into the process: for whom, to what ends, what types of access, etc? It felt like library values came in only at the end&#8230; Refocusing on ACRL Framework might better center the EDI values.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>### Q: How do you deal with issues of ownership, authorship, intellectual property in MakerLab?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Amy: Great Q, librarians and staff made a handout for students to help parse out whether it&#x27;s technically owned by the University (i.e. faculty designing something related to their own discipline), whether it&#x27;s the student&#x27;s intellectual property, etc. Gives Amy a good chance to talk about copyright with students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>---&nbsp;<br>Welcome to pad.riseup.net!<br><br>WARNING: This &quot;pad&quot; is a collaborative document that can be edited by anyone who has the URL.
