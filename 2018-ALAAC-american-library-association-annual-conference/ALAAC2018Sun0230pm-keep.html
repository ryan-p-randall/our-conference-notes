This etherpad is for the ALAAC2018 Sunday 2:30pm--3:30pm session:&nbsp;<br><strong>Breaking Below the Surface of Racism, Whiteness, and Implicit Bias</strong> <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;eventscribe&#x2e;com&#x2F;&#x2F;2018&#x2F;ALA&#x2d;Annual&#x2F;fsPopup&#x2e;asp&#x3f;Mode&#x3d;presInfo&amp;PresentationID&#x3d;352249">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventscribe.com&#x2F;&#x2F;2018&#x2F;ALA-Annual&#x2F;fsPopup.asp?Mode=presInfo&amp;PresentationID=352249</a><br><br>Please add your name using the &quot;multiple people&quot; icon on the right so we know who to thank for helping take group notes!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Starting off with a handout with a scenario from the perspective of &quot;Todd and &quot;Jamilah&quot; about implicit bias, microaggressions, etc&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Discussing scenario in small groups and sharing out what could be done in this situation&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Since the audience microphone isn&#x27;t wireless, April is doing a fantastic job of rephrasing &#x2F; repeating audience statements into her microphone for the group&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Can&#x27;t talk about race &amp; racism without talking about whiteness and implicit bias more broadly&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Implicit bias: assumptions, both concious and unconcious&nbsp;<br>Whiteness is a form of implicit bias based on race that&#x27;s also an ideology with whiteness, white values, white perspectives valued above those of people of color&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>whiteness can pop up anywhere, everywhere, since it&#x27;s rooted in centuries of our society&#x27;s deveopment&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Whiteness goes beyond overt hostile act; can be nice, polite, friendly while still being just as harmful&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&quot;Whiteness-berg&quot;:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - niceness, politeness vs overt racist acts, racial slurs above the waterline&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - microaggressions, implicit bias below the waterline; need to be pulled up to be addressed&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Another water analogy: whiteness is a fast-moving current; if you stand still, you&#x27;ll nevertheless be swept away. You have to resist, grab on to something, actively fight against the current.&nbsp; There is no way to be &#8216;neutral&#8217; in the current of whiteness.&nbsp;<br><br>How do we fight against this? By constantly bringing it to the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>to resist bias, need to name, question, challenge the bias&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&quot;I put this in the form of &#x27;you&#x27; because we do that.&quot; We make assumptions, we mess up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Anti racist Practice 1: You have trouble remembering how to pronounce your coworkers name. You ask them if they have a &#8216;more American&#8217; name you can use instead.<br><br>Ways to challenge bias (scenario 1): having a name you&#8217;re not familiar with doesn&#8217;t make a person &#8216;less American&#8217;, just because a name is unfamiliar doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t learn how to say it (you probably already know how to say other names but ones that are more familiar to you)<br><br>Anti racist Practice 2: You approach a Black woman behind the desk and ask her to get someone &#8216;more qualified&#8217; to answer your reference question.&nbsp;<br><br>Ways to challenge bias (scenario 2): The supervisor or other person can do a micro affirmation and assure the patron that the Black woman is the most qualified person to answer that question.&nbsp;<br><br>Anti racist Practice 3: You and your Latinx colleague are standing outside the restrooms. A student notifies you that the restrooms are out of toilet paper, and your colleague responds that they will let facilities know. The student replies, &#8220;Oh, I thought YOU worked for facilities.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ways to challenge bias (scenario 3):&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ask the offending person why they made the assumption, which allows them to work through the assumption themselves&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - nonjudgment tone is helpful&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &#8220;help me understand&#8221; etc&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - microaffirmations&nbsp;<br><br>Asked to define microaggression - usually unintentional, based on assumptions&nbsp;<br>microaffirmation: stepping in to rebut(?) the aggression taking place. Affirming humanity and dignity of the person&nbsp;<br><br>Audience member expresses concerns about swooping in and pushing aside and &#8216;saving&#8217; the person experiencing the microaggressions.&nbsp;<br>April says you can step in without stepping over or stepping in front of - that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a micro affirmation.&nbsp;<br><br>Always good to check in with the person later as to what their preference is and how they&#8217;d like you as an ally to handle it&nbsp;<br><br>Audience member says to think of a micro affirmation as a subtle indicator that this person belongs in this space.&nbsp;<br><br>The more you practice the more ready you are. Hard, uncomfortable work but important to do.&nbsp;<br><br>Audience Q: A boss-type asked a librarian what she thought about &#8216;those patrons&#8217; referring to a specific patron who is a woman of color with possible potential mental health issues and is experiencing homelessness.&nbsp;<br><br>April (in a happy voice with a smile): &#8220;What? Rose? I love Rose, she has great stories. I&#8217;m so glad she has a wonderful opportunity to come to the library. People think that libraries are irrelevant but isn&#8217;t it great that she can come here? I can&#8217;t imagine being without a home and not having access to resources, so I&#8217;m so glad that we are here for her!&#8221; And gives a shout out to her mom (who is in the audience) who taught her how to do this.&nbsp;<br><br>Audience Q: What if you&#8217;re trying to compliment someone and engaging in a microaggressions (ie: complimenting someone&#8217;s hair but one that exoticizes the hair)<br><br>April: Ask yourself why you want to engage in that specific conversation with that specific person. She uses the example of people complimenting her for being &#8216;so articulate&#8217; when they would never give that compliment to a white dude.<br><br>Audience Answer: We need to be in charge of hiring and hire diverse people. If a student assumes that a Latinx person is a facility worker, is that because our library ONLY hires Latinx people for facilities and ONLY hires white people for professional positions? &#8220;The conversation is the demonstration of what the customer sees&#8221;<br><br>List of recommended readings:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>---&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Welcome to pad.riseup.net!<br><br>WARNING: This &quot;pad&quot; is a collaborative document that can be edited by anyone who has the URL.
